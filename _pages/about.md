I am an undergraduate student at Delhi Technological University (and your friendly neighbourhood hack). I like to read, write, spend more hours than sustainable writing code and watch reruns of Bojack Horseman. (Do [email me]("mailto:anjalibhavan98@gmail.com") if you wish to share into the secret Bojack Horseman mini-fandom I’m a part of; it is every bit as unpretentious and sharp as the show itself is.)

My research interests include machine learning with a focus on ensemble learning methods - ensemble learning is the practice of combining multiple machine learning algorithms for (arguably) enhanced performance. I have worked on ensemble techniques for human activity recognition and emotion recognition from speech, and also written a technical report on the prevalent methods and applications of ensemble learning. Ensemble methods are highly popular among top-ranked performers on Kaggle due to their ability to raise the performance (usually accuracy in Kaggle’s context) of a single model manifold - but how much of this is sustainable keeping in mind the considerations of computational complexity forms an important aspect of ensemble learning research.

Of late I have begun taking an interest in natural language processing and speech and text processing, and am currently a part of various initiatives regarding the same. I look forward to building products related to them someday with my acquired skills. Apart from these I like to dabble with development and small-scale projects like bots and apps; I continue to hone my abilities further (at least where UI is concerned!) and delve into more interesting work. Small steps every day!

A brief description about myself cannot come to a close without talk about my writing. I have been, and would like to, pursue an equally-important, parallel career in literature; I have been published in several places, and continue to contribute and submit to many others. I also sincerely believe that one must not have to choose between the things they love; I have resolutely refused to choose between computer science academia and literature, and so far have been able to keep the two harmoniously separate. I hope to continue doing so in the future.

I am highly fond of literature, art, history, culture, philosophy and poetry, and maintain a fairly massive collection of content gathered over the past several years (I am currently building it as a Github repository). Contact me if you'd like to discuss anything regarding these (and anything else in general as well)!
