Apparently I gotta be visible on the internet to constantly put on display my life's work, so here goes nothing. And I have a LinkedIn 'cause please hire me for writing (code, papers, the shtick). Obviously I exist mostly in the real world and not so much online, but feel free to reach out to me (or not, you know) for any queries regarding my skills and experience. I like things and smile occasionally. I'm a good kid.
