Hello! I am a writer and researcher with interests in computational linguistics and natural language processing. I currently work as a software engineer at PayTM.

I recently graduated from Delhi Technological University with a Bachelor's of Technology in Mathematics and Computing. During my undergrad years I've been lucky to work with experts in pioneering institutions, and publish papers on my research. My work varies from speech and text processing to machine translation. I also like building things and contributing to open-source organizations - a recent contribution was to Apertium, an open-source machine translation toolkit.

Apart from this, I write on culture, entertainment and politics! I have been published by venues like FirstPost, The Hindu, Digital Spy and many others. I look forward to interesting work on language, technology and culture in the future.
